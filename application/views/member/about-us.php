				<p class="">
					The West Java Indigenous and Introduced Fish catalog website is an innovative project managed by the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN). This website aims to provide rich information about various endemic and introduced fish species in the West Java region.
				</p>
				<p class="">
					With technical support from the Faculty of Applied Sciences at Telkom University, this website was developed with a sophisticated and responsive approach to ensure accessibility for all users. The development of this website is carried out by a team of experts in their fields, including researchers, fisheries scientists and information technology experts, thus ensuring that the content presented is accurate and reliable.
				</p>
				<p class="">
					This catalog website not only provides a complete description of each endemic and introduced fish species, but also provides important data on habitat, geographic distribution, level of rarity, and conservation efforts that have been undertaken. In addition, users can also find the latest scientific articles and news related to fisheries research in the West Java region.
				</p>
				<p class="">
					It is hoped that this website will become an invaluable source of information for fisheries experts, researchers, students, and the general public who are concerned about biodiversity and the conservation of fish resources in West Java. With easy access to quality knowledge, it is hoped that it can also increase awareness and collective efforts in conserving natural wealth and aquatic ecosystems in the region.
